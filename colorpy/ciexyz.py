ciexyz.py - Spectral response curves for 1931 CIE XYZ 2 degree field of view matching functions.

Description:

This module provides the CIE standard XYZ color matching functions.
The 1931 tabulation, for a 2 degree field of view, is used in preference to the 10 degree 1964 set,
as is conventional in computer graphics.

The matching functions are stored internally at 1 nm increments, and linear interpolation is
used for any wavelength in between.

ColorPy attempts to scale the matching functions so that:
A spectrum, constant with wavelength, over the range 360 nm to 830 nm, with a total intensity
equal to the (assumed) physical intensity of the monitor, will sample with Y = 1.0.

This scaling corresponds with that in colormodels.py, which assumes Y = 1.0 at full white.

NOTE - I suspect that the scaling is not quite correct.  I think it is at least close.

Ideally, we would like the spectrum of the actual monitor display, at full white, which is not
independent of wavelength, to sample to Y = 1.0.

Constants and Functions:

start_wl_nm, end_wl_nm - Default starting and ending range of wavelengths, in nm, as integers.
delta_wl_nm            - Default wavelength spacing, in nm, as a float.

DEFAULT_DISPLAY_INTENSITY - Default assumed intensity of monitor display, in W/m^2

def init (monitor_intensity = DEFAULT_DISPLAY_INTENSITY) -
    Initialization of color matching curves.  Called at module startup with default arguments.
    This can be called again to change the assumed display intensity.

def empty_spectrum () -
    Get a black (no intensity) ColorPy spectrum.

    This is a 2D numpy array, with one row for each wavelength in the visible range,
    360 nm to 830 nm, with a spacing of delta_wl_nm (1.0 nm), and two columns.
    The first column is filled with the wavelength [nm].
    The second column is filled with 0.0.  It should later be filled with the intensity.

    The result can be passed to xyz_from_spectrum() to convert to an xyz color.

def xyz_from_wavelength (wl_nm) -
    Given a wavelength (nm), return the corresponding xyz color, for unit intensity.

def xyz_from_spectrum (spectrum) -
    Determine the xyz color of the spectrum.

    The spectrum is assumed to be a 2D numpy array, with a row for each wavelength,
    and two columns.  The first column should hold the wavelength (nm), and the
    second should hold the light intensity.  The set of wavelengths can be arbitrary,
    it does not have to be the set that empty_spectrum() returns.

def get_normalized_spectral_line_colors (
    brightness = 1.0,
    num_purples = 0,
    dwl_angstroms = 10):
    Get an array of xyz colors covering the visible spectrum.
    Optionally add a number of 'purples', which are colors interpolated between the color
    of the lowest wavelength (violet) and the highest (red).

    brightness - Desired maximum rgb component of each color.  Default 1.0.  (Maxiumum displayable brightness)
    num_purples - Number of colors to interpolate in the 'purple' range.  Default 0.  (No purples)
    dwl_angstroms - Wavelength separation, in angstroms (0.1 nm).  Default 10 A. (1 nm spacing)
