illuminants.py - Definitions of some standard illuminants.

Description:

Illuminants are spectrums, normalized so that Y = 1.0.

Spectrums are 2D numpy arrays, with one row for each wavelength,
with the first column holding the wavelength in nm, and the
second column the intensity.

The spectrums have a wavelength increment of 1 nm.

Functions:

init () -
    Initialize CIE Illuminant D65.  This runs on module startup.

get_illuminant_D65 () -
    Get CIE Illuminant D65, as a spectrum, normalized to Y = 1.0.

    CIE standard illuminant D65 represents a phase of natural daylight
    with a correlated color temperature of approximately 6504 K.  (Wyszecki, p. 144)

    In the interest of standardization the CIE recommends that D65 be used
    whenever possible.  Otherwise, D55 or D75 are recommended.  (Wyszecki, p. 145)

    (ColorPy does not currently provide D55 or D75, however.)

get_illuminant_A () -
    Get CIE Illuminant A, as a spectrum, normalized to Y = 1.0.
    This is actually a blackbody illuminant for T = 2856 K.  (Wyszecki, p. 143)

get_blackbody_illuminant (T_K) -
    Get the spectrum of a blackbody at the given temperature, normalized to Y = 1.0.

get_constant_illuminant () -
    Get an illuminant, with spectrum constant over wavelength, normalized to Y = 1.0.

scale_illuminant (illuminant, scaling) -
    Scale the illuminant intensity by the specfied factor.
